# 🔑 GitHub Authentication Required

I found your repo: **robbie2806/fossandvolt-template**

To push your code, you need to authenticate. Here's the easiest way:

---

## Option 1: GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create a Token
1. Go to: **https://github.com/settings/tokens**
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Name it: `PixieVolt Deploy`
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ **repo** (all checkboxes under repo)
5. Scroll down and click **"Generate token"**
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Give Me the Token
Send me the token that looks like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

I'll use it ONCE to push your code, then you can delete it from GitHub.

## Option 2: Use GitHub Desktop (Easier)

If you have a computer:
1. Download **GitHub Desktop**: https://desktop.github.com
2. Sign in to your GitHub account
3. Clone your repo: `robbie2806/fossandvolt-template`
4. I'll give you a `.zip` file of your code
5. Extract and copy files into the cloned folder
6. GitHub Desktop will show changes
7. Commit and push!

## Option 3: Deploy Directly to Railway (Skip GitHub)

Actually, **Railway can deploy without GitHub!**

1. Go to **https://railway.app**
2. Create new project
3. Select **"Empty Project"**
4. Click **"+ New"** → **"GitHub Repo"** → **"Configure GitHub App"**
5. Give Railway access to your `fossandvolt-template` repo

Then I'll help you push to GitHub after Railway is set up.

**Which option works best for you?**

- **Token:** Fastest, I can push immediately
- **GitHub Desktop:** Easiest if you have a computer
- **Railway Direct:** Skip GitHub for now, deploy straight to Railway
